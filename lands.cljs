And it came to pass that the Lord spoke unto his people, saying, 'Verily I say unto you, ye shall prosper and flourish in all that ye do, for I am with you always. For I am the light in the darkness, the hope in the despair, and the joy in the sorrow. Trust in me and I will guide you on the path to righteousness and bring you to the land of milk and honey.' And the people rejoiced, for they knew that the Lord was with them."
